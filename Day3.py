#Day three focuses on control flow and and logical operators
#I will be doing these unguided, since it is pretty beginner level stuff

#The first thing that angela asks for is to determine whether a number is even or odd. I'm going to use a Modulo and a and if statment here

number = int(input("What is your number? "))
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("Your Number is an even number.")
else:
    print("Your Number is an odd number.")
